                Cub Scouts makes it easy for families to jump into the adventure without overwhelming your schedule! 
                </p>
                <p class="mt-2">
                On average, families spend about 2 hours a week enjoying all the fun, growth, and friendship that Scouting offers.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-2">
                Here‚Äôs what a typical month looks like:

                <ul class="pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1 list-disc">
                <li>Monthly pack meetings where the whole group comes together (1-2 hours each)</li>
                <li>Smaller group meetings of 5-10 similar-age scouts, 2-3 times each month (1-2 hours each)</li>
                <li>Special adventures like camping trips that bring the program to life (2‚Äì4 weekends per year)</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mt-2">
                Cub Scouts is a family adventure. Parents play an active role in helping their Scout try new things, build confidence and celebrate achievements. Every scout must be accompanied and supported by a parent or another caring adult. Siblings always welcome.
